# TSA-Website

This project contains three main sections: a TSA promotion, a CTE promotion, and a deisgn brief response.

The TSA promotion contains information about the school TSA branch. 

The CTE promotion contains course descriptions, project examples, and other general information about Central Magnet's engineering program. 

The design brief response is a website for the band Cardboard Fantasy. The website includes a band biography, tour dates, a place to browse music, a place to purchase merchandise, and possibly a place to sign up for a newsletter.
